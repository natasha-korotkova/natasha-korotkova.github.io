(based on joint work w/ Pranav Anand)

Reported speech is a classic topic in linguistics and philosophy. It lies at the intersection of several areas, such as: syntax of clausal complementation, semantics of intensional predicates, speech act theory, context-sensitivity, puzzles of reference, the nature of mental content, and discourse analysis. The goal of this class is to provide a multi-faceted guided tour into the landscape of speech reports that would bring together different strands of research on this phenomenon, including recent work from psycholinguistic, morphosyntactic and pragmasemantic angles.
