I am a theoretical linguist with strong interests in philosophy. I work on meaning. My research lies mainly at the intersection of formal semantics, formal pragmatics and philosophy of language, with forays into syntax, prosody, and epistemology, and always has a firm cross-linguistic component.

I am currently an Assistant Professor (Universitair Docent; tenured) at Utrecht University, where I am a researcher at the Language, Logic and Information group at the [Institute for Language Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/institute-for-language-sciences) and teach in the Liberal Arts and Sciences program at the [University College Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/university-college-utrecht). Before coming to the Netherlands, I worked in Germany, at the [Linguistics Department](http://ling.uni-konstanz.de/pages/index_en.html) in Konstanz and at the Collaborative Research Center ["Construction of Meaning"](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/collaborative-research-centers/crc-833/) in Tübingen. Before that, I got my PhD in linguistics from UCLA. And before that, I got the most excellent education in linguistics at the Russian State University for the Humanities.

My research program centers on knowledge and belief: (i) the many means languages have to express epistemic and doxastic notions, (ii) the formal tools we need to descibe them, (iii) how they relate to the architercture of discourse, and (vi) how they inform our understanding of the natural language ontology. The specific phenomena I have worked on include evidentiality, modality, subjective language, attitude ascriptions, clausal complementation, speech acts, and question bias.
