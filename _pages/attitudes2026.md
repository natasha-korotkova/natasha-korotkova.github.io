<h2>Conceptual structure of attitudes: Language and Cognition</h2>

<h5>Organizers: Natasha Korotkova (Utrecht University) and Salvador Mascarenhas (École Normale Supérieure); with financial support from NWO (grant 406.XS.25.01.105; PI Korotkova)</h5>

Propositional attitudes, linguistically manifested through predicates like “believe”, “intend”, “know” or “want”, constitute one of the central topics in linguistics and philosophy, and they are the foundation of belief-desire-intention psychology. Propositional attitudes allow us to express key aspects of our mental lives for external use in communication and internal use in reasoning. They have been studied by linguists and philosophers, focusing on mathematically precise formulations of the conditions for truthful attitude ascriptions; and by psychologists, focusing on experimentally testing the behavioral consequences of attitudes. These traditions show considerable overlap and complementarity, yet their interaction over the past twenty years has been limited. In this interdisciplinary workshop, we bridge this gap by bringing together researchers from these different fields whose work bears on propositional attitudes. Our chief goal is to assess the state of the art on propositional attitudes, and to identify areas for interdisciplinary collaborations.
